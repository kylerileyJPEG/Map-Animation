# Real Time Bus Tracker

This was a project we did in the MIT coding program that tracked the bus stops between Harvard and MIT. I took the original code used for the project and converted it to a tracker for the best beaches to surf in San Diego (from morning till dawn). it uses all the same concepts as the bus tracker just with a fun twist!

I updated the colors of the original map to a dark scheme along with changing the water to be red. There was no particular reason for this, I was exploring the MapBox program and settled on this. I changed the coordinates to that of Sunset Cliffs, Ocean Beach, Crystal Pier, Blacks Beach & "Pipes" Encinitas. I then changed the button to say "Best beaches to surf in San Diego"

How to run:

Import files into your IDE of choice, and run the HTML provided into your web browser and hit enter! You'll see a button pop up over a map of Southern California, press that button and watch it cycle through the optimal beaches for surfing.

Roadmap to future improvements:

Potentially doing a survey along the coast of California to create a larger sample-size of beaches - then proceed to add these beaches to the array.
